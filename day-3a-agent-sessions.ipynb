    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",
    "> - *Tool Output*: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are **many exciting new developments in drug discovery driven by AI**. This is one of the most dynamic areas where AI is making a significant impact. Here are some of the key advancements:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **De Novo Drug Design:** AI models, particularly generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), are now capable of designing entirely *new* drug molecules from scratch. Instead of screening existing libraries, these AI systems can learn the underlying principles of molecular structure and function to propose novel compounds with desired properties (e.g., binding affinity to a specific target, low toxicity).\n",
      "*   **Optimizing Existing Molecules:** AI can also be used to iteratively improve upon existing drug candidates, suggesting modifications to enhance their efficacy, reduce side effects, or improve pharmacokinetic properties (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes the drug).\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Accelerated Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Uncovering Disease Mechanisms:** AI is being used to analyze vast biological datasets (genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, clinical data) to identify novel disease targets (e.g., specific proteins or genes that play a critical role in a disease). This helps researchers understand the underlying causes of diseases and pinpoint where to focus their drug development efforts.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Target-Drugability:** AI can help predict whether a newly identified target is \"druggable\" – meaning whether a small molecule or biologic can effectively interact with it to produce a therapeutic effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Enhanced Predictive Modeling for Efficacy and Safety:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Silico Screening:** AI models can predict how a potential drug will behave in the body and whether it will be effective against a disease target, often before expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments are conducted. This dramatically speeds up the initial screening process.\n",
      "*   **Toxicity Prediction:** AI is becoming increasingly adept at predicting potential toxic side effects of drug candidates by analyzing their chemical structure and comparing them to known toxic compounds, or by modeling their interactions with biological systems. This helps to de-risk the development process early on.\n",
      "*   **ADMET Prediction:** AI can predict Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties, crucial factors for a drug's success in the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Design and Patient Stratification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Identifying Optimal Patient Populations:** AI can analyze patient data to identify subgroups that are most likely to respond to a particular drug. This allows for more targeted clinical trials, potentially leading to faster approvals and more personalized treatments.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Trial Success:** AI can help predict the likelihood of success for a clinical trial based on various factors, allowing for better resource allocation and risk management.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI can sift through massive databases of existing drugs and scientific literature to identify potential new therapeutic uses for drugs that are already approved for other conditions. This can significantly shorten the development timeline and reduce costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Companies and Research Trends:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Many companies are at the forefront of this revolution, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its use of generative AI for drug discovery and its rapid progression of AI-discovered drugs into clinical trials.\n",

      "\n",
      "While progress is rapid, challenges remain:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data Quality and Availability:** The effectiveness of AI models is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of available data.\n",
      "*   **Explainability of AI Models:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a particular prediction (the \"black box\" problem) is crucial for regulatory approval and scientific trust.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Validation:** Ultimately, all AI-discovered or designed drugs must undergo rigorous clinical trials to prove their safety and efficacy in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, AI is fundamentally transforming drug discovery by making it faster, more efficient, more predictive, and more personalized. We are seeing an increasing number of AI-discovered and designed drugs entering clinical development, hinting at a future where new medicines can be brought to patients much more rapidly.\n",

      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to **Accelerated Target Identification**. This is a crucial step in drug discovery, and AI is making significant inroads here. Let me elaborate:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we dive into AI's role, it's important to understand what a drug target is. In the context of drug discovery, a target is typically a specific **molecule** in the body that a drug is designed to interact with. This molecule is often a:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Protein:** These are the workhorses of our cells, performing a vast array of functions. Many diseases involve the malfunction or over/under-activity of specific proteins. For example, enzymes, receptors, ion channels, and structural proteins can all be targets.\n",
      "*   **Gene/Nucleic Acid:** In some cases, the target might be a gene itself or the RNA it produces, especially in the development of therapies for genetic disorders or certain cancers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea is that by modulating the activity of this specific target – either by activating it, inhibiting it, blocking it, or even changing its structure – we can correct the underlying problem causing a disease and achieve a therapeutic effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI Accelerates Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, identifying and validating drug targets has been a laborious, often serendipitous, and time-consuming process involving extensive laboratory experiments and expert knowledge. AI revolutionizes this by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Analyzing Massive, Multi-Omics Datasets:**\n",
      "    *   **Genomics:** AI can analyze large-scale genomic data (like whole-genome sequencing) to identify genes that are mutated or expressed differently in disease states compared to healthy individuals.\n",
      "    *   **Transcriptomics:** AI can study RNA expression patterns to understand which genes are actively being transcribed, revealing cellular processes that are aberrant in disease.\n",
      "    *   **Proteomics:** AI can help identify and quantify proteins and their modifications, revealing which proteins are involved in disease pathways.\n",
      "    *   **Metabolomics:** AI can analyze the small molecules (metabolites) involved in cellular processes, uncovering metabolic disruptions associated with disease.\n",
      "    *   **Clinical Data:** AI can integrate these biological data with patient records (electronic health records, imaging data, patient-reported outcomes) to find correlations between biological markers and disease phenotypes.\n",
      "\n",
      "    **AI's role here is to find patterns and signals within these incredibly complex and noisy datasets that human researchers might miss.**\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Uncovering Novel Disease Mechanisms:**\n",
      "    *   By analyzing these integrated datasets, AI can help build more comprehensive models of disease pathways. It can identify novel proteins or genetic elements that play a critical role in disease initiation or progression, even if they weren't previously suspected.\n",
      "    *   This leads to the identification of **new therapeutic hypotheses**. Instead of just targeting well-known pathways, AI can point towards entirely new biological processes to intervene in.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Predicting \"Druggability\":**\n",
      "    *   Identifying a molecule that is implicated in a disease is only half the battle. The other half is determining if it's possible to create a drug that can effectively interact with it. This is called **druggability**.\n",
      "    *   AI models can be trained to predict the druggability of a potential target based on its structural features, its location within the cell, its known interactions with other molecules, and its biochemical properties. This helps researchers prioritize targets that are more likely to yield successful drug candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Network Biology and Systems Thinking:**\n",
      "    *   AI excels at understanding complex biological networks. It can map out how different proteins, genes, and pathways interact with each other.\n",
      "    *   By understanding these networks, AI can identify **bottlenecks** or critical nodes that, if modulated, could have a significant impact on the entire system and thus the disease state.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits of AI-Driven Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Speed:** Significantly reduces the time it takes to identify promising new targets.\n",
      "*   **Breadth:** Explores a much wider range of biological possibilities than manual methods.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** Uncovers targets that might not have been considered through traditional research.\n",
      "*   **Efficiency:** Helps prioritize research efforts on targets with a higher likelihood of success, saving resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In essence, AI acts as a powerful research assistant that can process and interpret vast amounts of biological information to highlight the most promising molecular players in a disease, paving the way for the development of entirely new classes of drugs.**\n",

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n",
